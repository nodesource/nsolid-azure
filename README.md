# N|Solid on Azure

[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/?v=18.07a) is a comprehensive set of cloud services that developers and IT professionals use to build, deploy, and manage applications through a global network of datacenters. Deploy your [N|Solid](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid) instances to the Azure cloud for cloud access to the only Node.js platform built for mission-critical applications.

## Getting Started

Easily run N|Solid in Azure using our [Resource Manager Templates](templates/). You can find a list of templates and their descriptions in the template's [README](/templates/README.md). Once you find a template you want to use, simply click the deploy button.

Follow these steps to use the [Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-portal) templates in `azure-nsolid`:

1. Find the template you want to run in the `/templates` folder, then click the **Deploy to Azure** button. This will open up a Custom Deployment in Azure Resource Manager in your own account.

2. Select either an existing Resource Group or create a new one.

3. Set the location to "West US".

4. Agree to the Terms and Conditions.
